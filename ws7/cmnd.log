#use sed to change',' to ' ' and use awk to identify the frequency of the tip amounts from the customers who paid more than and equal to US$ 10.0 of the total amount.

#use awk to print frequency of the tip amounts as first column and tip amounts as second column. Then list the 20 lines in descending order.  


awk '{print $1}' results.txt > ws7.txt
#use awk to print tip amounts only to ws7.txt
